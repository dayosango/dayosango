<h1 align='center'> Hi there, I'm Dayo  ðŸ‘‹ </h1>

---

I am a **Junior Data Scientist** based in London, passionate about utilising data analytics to positively impact communities across the world.


- :dizzy: Excited about all things data, machine learning and AI, and looking for opportunities to connect with others on a similar journey. 

- :books: Currently learning more about Big Data processing (AWS, Hadoop, Spark), Tensowflow and SQL.

- :thought_balloon: When I am not thinking of ways to save the world with my code... I am trawling through the city, cuisine by cuisine or booking my next travel destination (not just with the sole purpose of trying out new foods...).
